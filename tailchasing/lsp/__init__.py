"""
Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation for real-time tail-chasing detection.

This would enable VS Code, Neovim, and other editors to show tail-chasing 
issues as you type, similar to how Pylance works.

Key features:
- Real-time semantic analysis as you type
- Hover tooltips showing semantic similarity scores
- Code actions to merge semantic duplicates
- Inline suggestions when creating potential tail-chasing patterns
