"""Catalytic Optimization Package.

This package provides catalytic optimization features for accelerating code analysis
and improving the efficiency of tail-chasing pattern detection. The catalytic concept
is inspired by enzyme catalysis in biochemistry, where catalysts lower the activation
energy needed for reactions to occur.

In the context of code analysis, catalytic optimization:

1. **Accelerates Analysis**: Speeds up pattern detection by pre-computing and caching
   common analysis patterns, reducing the computational overhead of repeated operations.

2. **Selective Processing**: Uses intelligent filtering to focus analysis effort on
   code regions most likely to contain issues, similar to how enzymes selectively
   bind to specific substrates.

3. **Progressive Refinement**: Implements multi-stage analysis pipelines where initial
   fast passes identify candidates for more detailed analysis, mimicking the way
   catalytic processes can have multiple steps.

4. **Adaptive Optimization**: Learns from analysis patterns to optimize future runs,
   adjusting analysis strategies based on codebase characteristics and historical
   findings.

Key Components (Future Implementation):

- **Catalytic Analyzers**: Enhanced analyzers with built-in optimization and caching
- **Substrate Selectors**: Components that identify promising code regions for analysis
- **Reaction Accelerators**: Utilities for speeding up common analysis operations
- **Enzyme Libraries**: Reusable catalytic components for specific analysis types
- **Activation Energy Profilers**: Tools for measuring and optimizing analysis performance

Biological Inspiration:
- Enzymes lower activation energy to accelerate reactions
- Specific substrate binding ensures selective catalysis
- Allosteric regulation allows dynamic optimization
- Catalytic cycles enable repeated efficient processing
- Competitive inhibition can prioritize important reactions

Code Analysis Application:
- Pattern libraries reduce analysis overhead
- Intelligent filtering focuses on relevant code
- Caching mechanisms speed up repeated operations
- Adaptive algorithms optimize based on codebase patterns
- Priority systems handle analysis resource allocation
