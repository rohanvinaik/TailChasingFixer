        üîç **Tail-Chasing Pattern Detected: Phantom Function**
        
        **What happened:**
        The LLM created a stub function `{issue.symbol}` that contains no real implementation 
        (just `pass` or `raise NotImplementedError`). This typically happens when the LLM 
        encounters an import error and creates a placeholder to satisfy it, but then never 
        returns to implement the actual functionality.
        
        **Why this is problematic:**
        - The function exists but does nothing useful
        - Code calling this function will fail at runtime
        - It masks the real problem (why was this function needed?)
        - Future LLM iterations might try to "fix" code that calls this phantom
        
        **Root cause:**
        The LLM likely saw an error like "NameError: name '{issue.symbol}' is not defined" 
        and created an empty function instead of understanding why the reference existed.
        
        **Recommended fix:**
        1. Delete the phantom function
        2. Investigate why it was referenced in the first place
        3. Either implement it properly or remove all references to it
        4. If it's truly needed, provide the LLM with clear requirements for what it should do
        
        **Similar patterns in your codebase:**
        Look for other functions that only contain `pass`, `...`, or `NotImplementedError`.

        üîç **Tail-Chasing Pattern Detected: Circular Import**
        
        **What happened:**
        The LLM created a circular dependency chain: {' ‚Üí '.join(cycle[:3])}{'...' if len(cycle) > 3 else ''}
        Each module tries to import from another in the chain, creating an infinite loop.
        
        **Why this is problematic:**
        - Python cannot resolve circular imports at module level
        - The code will crash with ImportError when any module in the cycle is imported
        - It indicates poor separation of concerns
        
        **Root cause:**
        The LLM tried to fix an import error by adding imports without understanding the 
        module structure. Each "fix" created a new dependency that eventually circled back.
        
        **Recommended fix:**
        1. Identify the shared functionality causing the circular dependency
        2. Extract it to a separate module that others can import from
        3. Use import-at-function-level as a temporary workaround if needed
        4. Restructure the code to have clear, one-way dependencies
        
        **Prevention tip:**
        When prompting the LLM, provide clear module structure: "Module A should not import from Module B"

        üîç **Tail-Chasing Pattern Detected: Duplicate Implementation**

        The LLM created multiple versions of essentially the same function in different locations:
        {self._format_locations(locations[:3])}
        
        **Why this is problematic:**
        - Violates DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
        - Bug fixes must be applied multiple times
        - Increases maintenance burden
        - Confuses which version should be used
        
        **Root cause:**
        Instead of finding and importing an existing function, the LLM recreated it. This often 
        happens when the LLM loses track of what's already implemented or works with limited context.
        
        **Recommended fix:**
        1. Choose the most complete/documented version as the canonical implementation
        2. Delete all other versions
        3. Update all imports to use the canonical version
        4. Consider moving to a shared utility module if used across multiple files

        Tell the LLM explicitly: "Check if this functionality already exists before implementing"

        üîç **Tail-Chasing Pattern Detected: Semantic Duplicate**
        
        **What happened:**
        The LLM created functions that do the same thing but with different names or slight 
        implementation variations. These functions are {evidence.get('similarity', 0):.0%} similar 
        in their behavior despite looking different.
        
        **Why this is problematic:**
        - Hidden duplication is harder to maintain than obvious duplication
        - Different names for the same concept create confusion
        - Teams waste time understanding why there are multiple ways to do the same thing
        
        **Root cause:**
        The LLM implemented the same logic multiple times, possibly with different prompts or 
        in different sessions, without recognizing the existing implementation.
        
        **Recommended fix:**
        1. Review all semantically similar functions
        2. Identify the core functionality they share
        3. Create one well-named function that handles all use cases
        4. Replace all variations with calls to the unified function
        
        **Detection insight:**
        Our semantic analysis looked beyond names and syntax to identify these duplicates by 
        analyzing data flow, return patterns, and overall structure.

        üîç **Tail-Chasing Pattern Detected: Missing Symbol Import**
        
        **What happened:**
        The code tries to import `{issue.symbol}` but it doesn't exist in the target module. 
        This is likely a hallucinated import where the LLM assumed something exists when it doesn't.
        
        **Why this is problematic:**
        - The code will fail with ImportError at runtime
        - It might trigger the LLM to create phantom implementations
        - It indicates the LLM is guessing rather than checking
        
        **Root cause:**
        The LLM either misremembered the module structure or tried to import something that 
        seemed logical but doesn't actually exist.
        
        **Recommended fix:**
        1. Remove the invalid import
        2. Find where this symbol is actually defined (if anywhere)
        3. If it doesn't exist, either implement it properly or refactor to not need it
        4. Verify all imports against actual module contents

        üîç **Tail-Chasing Pattern Detected: Trivial Wrapper**
        
        **What happened:**
        The function `{issue.symbol}` is just a thin wrapper that calls another function 
        without adding any value (no validation, transformation, or additional logic).
        
        **Why this is problematic:**
        - Adds unnecessary indirection
        - Makes code harder to follow
        - No real abstraction benefit
        - Often indicates the LLM is creating structure without purpose
        
        **Root cause:**
        The LLM might be over-engineering or trying to maintain a pattern (like always having 
        a service layer) even when it adds no value.
        
        **Recommended fix:**
        1. Remove the wrapper function
        2. Have callers use the wrapped function directly
        3. Only keep wrappers that add real value (validation, logging, transformation)
        
        **Code smell indicator:**
        Wrappers should have a clear purpose. If you can't explain why the wrapper exists 
        in one sentence, it probably shouldn't exist.

        that reference each other but have no connection to the rest of your codebase. 
        Components involved: {len(components)} interdependent pieces.
        
        **Why this is problematic:**
        - Large amount of useless code that looks legitimate
        - These components only make sense together, not individually
        - High complexity with zero actual functionality
        - Future modifications might try to "fix" this fictional system
        
        **Root cause:**
        The LLM encountered an error and started creating supporting infrastructure for its fix, 
        then needed more infrastructure for that infrastructure, creating a cascade of fictional code.
        
        **Recommended fix:**
        1. DELETE THE ENTIRE HALLUCINATED SUBSYSTEM
        2. Go back to the original error that triggered this

        similar, suggesting the LLM forgot about the earlier implementation.

        - Future edits might update one version but not the other
        - Makes the file unnecessarily long and complex
        
        **Root cause:**
        The LLM's context window couldn't hold the entire file, so when asked to implement 
        something, it didn't realize it had already done so earlier.

        This pattern indicates the LLM is making changes without fully understanding the context, 
        leading to a cycle of fixes that create new problems.
        
        **Recommended actions:**
        {chr(10).join(f"- {s}" for s in (issue.suggestions or ["Review and fix manually"]))}
        
        **General advice:**
        When you see tail-chasing patterns, it's a sign to stop the automated fixes and 
        understand the root cause manually.
