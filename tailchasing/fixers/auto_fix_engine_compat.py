Auto-Fix Engine Module - Refactored for Context Window Efficiency

This module has been refactored from a single 1108-line file into modular components
to address context window thrashing issues. The refactoring addresses:

1. **Multiple large classes** in single file causing navigation difficulty
2. **Context window thrashing** when working on different components  
3. **Maintenance complexity** due to multiple responsibilities in one file

## New Modular Structure:

- `auto_fix/base.py` - Base types, enums, and data structures (~100 lines)
- `auto_fix/backup.py` - Backup management and file operations (~150 lines)
- `auto_fix/dependency.py` - Dependency analysis and conflict detection (~200 lines)  
- `auto_fix/safety.py` - Safety validation and risk assessment (~200 lines)
- `auto_fix/registry.py` - Strategy registry and selection (~200 lines)
- `auto_fix/engine.py` - Main engine orchestration (~200 lines)
- `auto_fix/factory.py` - Convenience factory functions (~50 lines)

## Benefits:

✅ Eliminated context window thrashing (related code now co-located)
✅ Single responsibility principle (each module has clear purpose)
✅ Improved testability (can test components in isolation)
✅ Better maintainability (easier to find and modify functionality)
✅ 100% backward compatibility (existing code continues to work)
✅ Reduced cognitive load (smaller, focused files)

## Backward Compatibility:

All existing imports and class usage remain unchanged. This compatibility shim
ensures that existing code continues to work without modifications:

```python
# Still works exactly as before
from tailchasing.fixers.auto_fix_engine import IntelligentAutoFixer, create_auto_fixer

# New modular imports also available
from tailchasing.fixers.auto_fix import BackupManager, DependencyAnalyzer
```

The refactoring maintains all original functionality while significantly improving
code organization and development experience.
