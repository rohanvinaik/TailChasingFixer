# Note: If you encounter dependency conflicts with other packages:
# 
# 1. For boltons conflicts (e.g., with semgrep):
#    This package doesn't use boltons directly. The conflict is with
#    other packages in your environment. Consider using a virtual environment.
#
# 2. For pydantic conflicts (e.g., with web3):
#    This package doesn't use pydantic directly. If needed, you can install
#    in a separate virtual environment to avoid conflicts.
#
# Recommended installation in a clean virtual environment:
#   python -m venv tailchasing-env
#   source tailchasing-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: tailchasing-env\Scripts\activate
#   pip install tail-chasing-detector
