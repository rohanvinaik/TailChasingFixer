## Configuration Tuning Guide

### For Small Codebases (< 1,000 functions)

- Single-threaded processing

### For Medium Codebases (1,000 - 10,000 functions)
- Enable intelligent sampling
- Standard LSH parameters (bands=20, rows=5)
- Use 2-4 worker processes

### For Large Codebases (10,000 - 100,000 functions)
- Stratified sampling with max_sample=500
- Increased LSH parameters (bands=32, rows=4)
- Use all available CPU cores
- Enable disk caching

### For Huge Codebases (> 100,000 functions)
- Progressive analysis with checkpointing
- Maximum LSH parameters (bands=50, rows=4)
- Distributed processing if available

## Troubleshooting

### Out of Memory Errors
- Reduce `max_sample_size` in configuration
- Enable disk caching with `use_disk_cache=True`
- Increase swap space on system
- Use incremental analysis with checkpointing

### Slow Performance
- Check CPU utilization (should be > 80%)
- Verify parallel processing is enabled
- Tune LSH parameters for your similarity threshold
- Profile with `--profile` flag to identify bottlenecks

### Accuracy Issues
- Increase sampling size for large codebases
- Reduce LSH bands for higher recall
- Adjust similarity thresholds
- Verify progressive encoding levels
